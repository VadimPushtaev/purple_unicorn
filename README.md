# Purple Unicorn
Simple telegram bot with webhooks. It's good for being deployed on Heroku.

## What it can
* roll dice (such as 1d6, 1d20 and so on) even when they are part of complex expression (e.g. (2d6 + 5)*3 - 1d20 )
* roll dice for group of characters and sort results (e.g. when everyone should roll initiative or make save throws)
* send random messages or stickers if you want to speak with it
* just be cool
