# Purple Unicorn
Simple telegram bot with webhooks. It's good for being deployed on Heroku.

## What it can
* roll dice (such as 1d6, 1d20 and so on) even when they are part of complex expression (e.g. (2d6 + 5)*3 - 1d20 )
* roll dice for group of characters and sort results (e.g. when everyone should roll initiative or make save throws)
* send random messages or stickers with purple unicorn ( https://tlgrm.ru/stickers/UnicornStella ) if you want to speak with it
* just be cool

## Used libs
python-telegram-bot 5.3.0 - nice API for telegram
dice-parser 0.3 - special parser for dice rolling by V.Pushtaev ( https://github.com/VadimPushtaev/dice_parser )
